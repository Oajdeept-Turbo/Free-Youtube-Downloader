👻 **Aesthetic**

The icon is deliberately unsettling—designed to evoke dread, confusion, and admiration. Ideal for horror setups, cursed desktops, or confusing your sysadmin. Think: _“haunted downloader meets forbidden sysadmin ritual.”_

🕯️ **Note**

This project is part of a larger experiment in theatrical scripting. Expect updates with unsafe glyphs, glitch effects, and fantasy GUI stages. Subscribe to the chaos.
